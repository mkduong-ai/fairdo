Mutation Methods
================

This module implements various mutation methods used in genetic algorithms.
These methods are used to introduce diversity in the population by randomly altering the genes of the individuals.
Each function in this module takes a population of individuals as input and returns a mutated population.
**The mutation happens outplace**, meaning that the original population is not modified.
The rate of mutation can be specified by the user.

These mutation methods are based on the works of the following references:

Goldberg, D. E. (1989). Genetic Algorithms in Search, Optimization, and Machine Learning. Addison-Wesley.

BÃ¤ck, T. (1993). Optimal Mutation Rates in Genetic Search.
