# Fairness-Agnostic Data Optimization

**FairDo** is a Python package for mitigating bias in data.

**FairDo** works specifically for tabular data (`pandas.DataFrame`) where the data is pre-processed in
such a way that it becomes fair according to a user-given fairness metric.
The pre-processing approach is **fairness-agnostic**, enabling the optimization
of different fairness criteria.
The framework is able to deal with **non-binary** protected attributes
such as nationality, race, and gender that arise in real-world datasets.
Due to the possibility of choosing between any of the available fairness metrics,
it is possible to aim for the **least fortunate group
(Rawls' A Theory of Justice [2]) or the general utility of all groups
(Utilitarianism)**.

### How does it work?
The pre-processing methods (`fairdo.preprocessing.HeuristicWrapper` and `fairdo.preprocessing.DefaultPreprocessing`)
work by **removing discriminatory data points**.
By doing so, the dataset becomes much more balanced and less biased towards
a particular social group.
We approach this task as a **combinatorial optimization problem**, which
means selecting a subset of the dataset that minimizes the discrimination score.
Because there are exponentially many possibilities for selecting a subset,
our approach uses **genetic algorithms** to find a fair subset.

### Advices
:rocket: **For a quick start**, use the `DefaultPreprocessing` class with the default settings.
An example is given in `tutorials/1. Default Preprocessor` and below.

:white_check_mark: **For data quality**, you want to keep the original data $D$
and only add fair synthetic data $G$ on top of it.
(We include examples in `tutorials/` where we use the [SDV](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV) package
to generate synthetic data.)
For this, you need to specify
`.fit_transform(approach='add')` for the pre-processors `fairdo.preprocessing.HeuristicWrapper` and
`fairdo.preprocessing.DefaultPreprocessing`.
This will only add the fair pre-processed synthetic data
to the original data.

:dash: **When having limited data**, we advise employing synthetic data $G$ additionally
and merge it with the original data $D$, i.e., $D \cup G$.
The pre-processor can then be used on the merged data $D \cup G$ to ensure fairness.
It is also possible to use the methodology for **data quality**, as described above.

:briefcase: **When anonymity is required**, only use synthetic data $G$ and do not
merge it with the original data $D$. The generated data $G$ can then be
pre-processed with our methods to ensure fairness.

## Quick Example Usage

In the following example, we use the COMPAS [1] dataset.
The protected attribute is _race_ and the label is _recidivism_.
Here, we deploy the **default pre-processor**, which internally uses a genetic algorithm,
to remove discriminatory samples of the given dataset.
The default pre-processor prevents removing all individuals of a single group.

```python
# fairdo package
from fairdo.utils.dataset import load_data
from fairdo.preprocessing import DefaultPreprocessing
# fairdo metrics
from fairdo.metrics import statistical_parity_abs_diff_max

# Loading a sample dataset with all required information
# data is a pandas.DataFrame
data, label, protected_attributes = load_data('compas', print_info=False)

# Initialize DefaultPreprocessing object
preprocessor = DefaultPreprocessing(protected_attribute=protected_attributes[0],
                                    label=label)

# Fit and transform the data
data_fair = preprocessor.fit_transform(dataset=data)

# Print no. samples and discrimination before and after
disc_before = statistical_parity_abs_diff_max(data[label],
                                              data[protected_attributes[0]].to_numpy())
disc_after = statistical_parity_abs_diff_max(data_fair[label],
                                             data_fair[protected_attributes[0]].to_numpy())
print(len(data), disc_before)
print(len(data_fair), disc_after)
```

By running this example, the **resulting dataset** usually has a statistical **disparity score of <1%** (max. score between all five races),
while the **original dataset exhibits 27% statistical disparity**.

## Installation
First, setup a Python environment. We recommend using [Miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html). Activate the created environment afterwards and finally install our package.
A detailed guide is given as follows.

### Dependencies
Python (==3.8), `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `sklearn`

### Setup Conda Environment
Download Miniconda [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/index.html).

```bash
# Create a conda virtual environment
conda create -n "venv" python=3.8

# Activate conda environment
conda activate venv
```

**OR**

### Setup Python Environment

```bash
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.venv\Scripts\activate

# On macOS and Linux:
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### PyPI Distribution (recommended)

The package is distributed via PyPI and can be directly installed with:
```bash
pip install fairdo
```

### Manual Installation (latest version)

To install the latest (development) version, execute following commands:
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/mkduong-ai/fairdo.git

# Move to repo folder
cd fairdo

# Install from source
python setup.py install
```

### Development Installation

Installing in development mode is useful to make changes in the source code take effect instantly.
This means that the package is installed in such a way that changes to the source code
are immediately reflected without the need to reinstall the package. This can be done in the following
way:
```bash
# Clone repo
git clone https://github.com/mkduong-ai/fairdo.git

# Move to repo folder
cd fairdo

# Development installation
pip install -e.
```

### Install Optional Dependencies

To use the synthetic data generation, you can install the `SDV` package
by executing the following command:
```bash
pip install sdv==1.10.0
```

We did not include the `SDV` package as a dependency, because it is not required
for the core functionality of the **FairDo** package.
Using any other synthetic data generation package is also possible.
Still, some examples in the `tutorials/` folder require the `SDV` package.
